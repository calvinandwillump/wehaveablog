                We Have a Blog
                <p>
                    Hello my name is Calvin and I will run this blog with
                    my good friend and fellow colleague Sameer. Anyways 
                    pizza with milk is amazing I don't know why no one 
                    else drinks it, as it is very underrated, like apples 
                    on a lawn mower. I just don't get how some people don't 
                    see such art? are they blind or just cant see things in a 
                    artistic sort of way like I do? So as I was saying the galaxy 
                    is very big but what if it wasn't as big as an atom what if 
                    an atom is so small its just that big but we cant see it 
                    because we live in the atom that's why the atom bomb has 
                    such a big explosion its represents the giant size of an atom.
