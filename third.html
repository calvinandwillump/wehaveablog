                    I’m a mature person, an old person, so i sleep at 10pm and not 8. Ok ladies or gentlemen don't go swooning over me just yet, you haven't heard everything yet I can also type without looking at my keyboard! Yes I know thats a very attractive trait. Now i’m sure YOU the reader behind the screen must be wondering how many lovers I have and i’ll tell you, I have none but once I say my signature one liner, "you have something ugly on your head oh wait its just your face." They will all come running to wait in line for me until I escort them to the room of rejection because we all know I am just way out of everyones league, i’m just untouchable.

                    To see the world as I do you just have memorise the terms and conditions of Candy Crush Saga, specifically on the windows lumia 540 mobile device, then screenshot (@m.mxsonn on Instagram)'s account about 10 times to really grasp the knowledge, but if this is too hard to remember just download a PDF of this message on Yahoo and hopefully someone will buy you a new guitar for your birthday.

                    Hello my name is Calvin and I will run this blog with my good friend and fellow colleague Sameer. Anyways pizza with milk is amazing I don't know why no one else drinks it, as it is very underrated, like apples on a lawn mower. I just don't get how some people don't see such art? are they blind or just cant see things in a artistic sort of way like I do? So as I was saying the galaxy is very big but what if it wasn't as big as an atom what if an atom is so small its just that big but we cant see it because we live in the atom that's why the atom bomb has such a big explosion its represents the giant size of an atom.
